# Functional Programming Principles
Projects done in OCaml to demonstrate principles of programming languages.
Projects include:

fa.ml - Implementation of finite state automota in OCaml.

dtree.ml - Implementation of binary decision trees in OCaml.

PROC - Creation of a programming language that can evaluate expressions and procedures based on its own abstract syntax tree.

REC-M - Extension of PROC that allows implementation of mutually recursive functions.

CHECKED - Extension of REC that implements type checking.

SOOL - Extension of REC that stores memory dynamically to allow object oriented programming.

PROC, REC-M, CHECKED, and SOOL require dune utop to compile.
